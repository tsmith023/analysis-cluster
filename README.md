# stox-analysis

A cluster of Go and Python microservices backed by Mongo and Redis storage and plugged into the [IeX Cloud API](https://iexcloud.io/) for performing investment portfolio analysis & optimisation over JSON HTTP.

You will need to provide an IeX Cloud API key to the `iex` service in order for the entire analysis pipeline to operate successfully. However, provided you have this, simply bring up the stack using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and inspect the OpenAPI specification for the stack, which is auto-generated by FastAPI, at `http://localhost:9000/docs`.
